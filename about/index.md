Originally from New York City, I am living in Montreal, Canada. With my background in both Art History and Computer Science, I am very interested in finding ways in which technology and software complement art history and the fine arts. Technology has proven to add value and foster innovation in various other domains and I firmly believe that this is the case in the arts. I am an enthusiastic, self motivated individual with a strong drive and ambition.
