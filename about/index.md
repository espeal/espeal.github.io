Originally from New York City, I am currently studying software engineering with a minor in art history at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Although these two subjects may not seem relevant, I am interested in the ways technology and software complement art history and the fine arts. Technology has proven to add value and foster innovation in various other domains and I firmly believe that this is the case in the arts. I am an enthusiastic, self motivated individual with a strong drive and ambition. When Iâ€™m not in school or working, I enjoying spending time with my friends, running, and watching hockey.
